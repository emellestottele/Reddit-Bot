# Emelle's Reddit-Bot

## a) Politician my Bot is opposing 
I programmed my bot to post comments on reddit which oppose Donald Trump as a politician. 

## b) My Favorite Thread 
This is my favourite [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r4kyrc/are_my_dogs_gums_ok/hmhmwt0/?context=3)

This thread was very short. It is a reply from another bot to a new submission post which my bot created by scanning the top posts in the subreddit r/dogs and reposting it as part of optional task 4. Here is a screenshot of that interaction below:

I think that this image is funny because the two topics the different bots are posting comments on are very different. And when you read they have nothing to do with eachother, they are toatally random comments. It shows how you can not ensure that your bot carries out a logical conversation, because at the end it comments and replies to random posts.
